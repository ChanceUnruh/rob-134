# ROB-134: Robot Perception and Manipulation

This repository contains my labs and final project for the **Robot Perception and Manipulation (ROB-134)** course, part of the **Robotics Program** at **WSU Tech**. The class focuses on robotics concepts such as perception, manipulation, and control, with an emphasis on integrating **OpenCV** and **ROS (Robot Operating System)** for practical applications. These projects are hands-on labs completed as part of my coursework.

## About the Course
ROB-134 is a core class in the Robotics Program at WSU Tech. It explores how robots perceive their environments and execute manipulation tasks. In this course, we primarily use **OpenCV** for computer vision tasks (e.g., image processing, object detection) and integrate it with **ROS** for robot control, simulation, and system communication.

## Repository Contents
The projects in this repository are individual lab assignments that demonstrate the use of OpenCV and ROS. Each lab folder (if applicable) includes code, configuration files, and documentation showcasing the integration of these tools to achieve specific robotics objectives.

## Tools and Technologies
- **OpenCV**: Used for computer vision tasks such as image processing, feature detection, and real-time perception.
- **ROS**: Used as the framework for robot control, sensor data handling, and system integration.

## Purpose
These labs are part of my training in the Robotics Program at WSU Tech during the Spring 2025 semester. They highlight my ability to apply OpenCV and ROS to solve real-world robotics challenges and are intended for educational purposes.

## Note
This repository is a work in progress as I complete the labs throughout the semester. Check back for updates as I add more projects!
